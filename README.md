This is the fourth assignment for the Georgia Tech Boot Camp - 2018.

In this assignment, we were required to create a fun and interactive game using web browsers highlighting our ability to use JQuery. The app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

The Game is Titled:
<b>Crystal Collector</b>

Instructions:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals on the page. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You can dwin the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
